        story: "The story of Goa is in many ways our story. And we decided to tell its story from the point of view of an old mermaid. We decided to make the mermaid speak to us.",
        author: "CHINKI SINHA /",
        full_story: "A fishing net, thrown at the point of India, brought in fifteen men of the seas which were immediately sent to the Lisbon Court. Thirteen died during the voyage. The only ones to survive were a woman and a young girl. They came to King Manuel who never grew tired of admiring them. The Oceanides appearing very sad, the King had them lowered into a shallow place in the sea, bearing light chains which prevented them from escaping. And the Court, aboard boats, were able to watch their evolutions. These creatures lived for a few years during which, each day, they were taken to the sea. But they were never able to learn to speak.” There were all these mermaids. Rising from the sea on the walls of Institute Menezes Braganza in Panjim in Goa, they are from the Island of Love in Canto IX written by Portuguese writer Luís Vaz de Camões first published in 1572 as an ode to the discovery of a sea route to India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama. The six azulejo panels are a mosaic of porcelain tiles that were fixed in Goa around 1935-36. In this one, the Greek goddess, Venus stands on a clam shell pushed by a merman and a mermaid, and is seen offering sailors refuge on this Island along with mermaids and sea creatures. Goa is dotted with mermaids. Indigo statues that lead to the Museum of Goa. There must be some connection. I saw one in a fountain with a broken limb once in a garden called Jardim de Sereia (Mermaid Garden). In the 1970s, the garden was indeed a garden. Then, there was a beautification drive. Casinos appeared on the horizon and the mermaid became a painted lady with a pinkish torso with black eyes and red nipples. They say there were so many layers of paint on the white statue that it made her wavy hair straight. The statue was vandalised a few times and restored. That’s how the conversation about mermaids came about. From the stories we read as children. Like The Little Mermaid by Hans Christian Andersen where a mermaid doesn’t get to live happily ever after despite her decision to bleed and become human for the sake of love. A line from that tale has haunted me since. “But a mermaid has no tears, and therefore she suffers so much more,” Anderson wrote. "

        full_story: "At around 3 am, the last of the strobe lights had stopped bouncing off the rocky shore­line off Guru Bar in the beach village of Anjuna. Irrespective of when the sun disappe­ars from the sky, nights in Anjuna effectively set in when restaurant and club owners eventually dec­i­de to put the day out of its misery. It’s only when they switch off their electrical fixtures and large speakers, blaring electronic music, that the cras­hing waves and the luminescence of the sea reclaim their brief moments of solitude. That’s before the sun rises once again.Moments after the strobing beams were turned off, something shimmered in the dark, swirling waters around a rocky outcrop, a couple of hundred metres from the bar’s now-empty deckchairs. The dull blaze of silverish grey caught a sliver of moonlight as the form emerged from the water. Just as a large cloud briefly hid the moon, her gnarled hands grabbed hold of a rock as she hoicked herself onto a narrow shelf."

        author: "MAYABHUSHAN NAGVENKAR /",
        full_story: "In 2015, a new batch of ration cards issued in the port town of Vasco da Gama pulled Goa back into the vortex of history. The cards appeared to have rechristened the port town as Sambhajinagar, after Maratha king Shivaji’s ambitious son. It was later officially denied.Sambhaji tends to evoke strong reactions among the followers of St. Francis Xavier, a 16th century Spanish Jesuit priest regarded as the patron saint of Goa and whose relics are entombed in one of the state’s most iconic churches, the Basilica of Bom Jesus. Sambhaji was on the verge of attacking Portuguese-held Goa in 1683 when the region’s Governor Dom Francisco De Tavora buckled. He opened the casket which held the Jesuit priest’s remains and placed his official sceptre in the dead saint’s hand, as if handing over his fate, and that of the land he governed, to the saint. His ‘miracle’, according to Christian lore, is believed to have ‘saved’ Portuguese Goa from Sambhaji’s onslaught.Cut to 2022. New miracles are in the process of being re-invented. The legacy of St. Francis is being questioned by the BJP-led coalition government, which has pitched mythical sage Para­shuram against the Navarra-born saint. Para­s­huram, according to former state RSS chief Subhash Velingkar, shot an arrow into the Arabian Sea, which pushed the waters back to the horizon, creating a wetland now known as Goa. “Francis Xavier is not the protector of Goa, Parashuram is. Xavier, through the Goa Inquisition, committed atrocities on Goans,” Velingkar says.Velingkar’s claim comes on the heels of the coalition’s latest initiative to restore temples des­troyed by the Portuguese colonists, in a bid to  cajole a wave of Hindu revivalism in Goa. For generations now, the awkward absence of consistent and rigorous public discourse about Goa’s colonial history had led to a tentatively harmonious co-exi­stence of Hindus, Catholics and Muslims in the state. But the state’s rapidly changing demography due to in and out-migration patterns, as well as the consolidation of the Hindu right-wing in positions of authority, have led to questions being asked about history. The most recent communal clash in the state occurred on the occasion of Ram Navami in April. Organisations like the Sanatan Sanstha, headquartered in Goa, claim that its cred is “teaching spirituality comprehensively”, but it also believes that forming a Hindu nation “is the only answer to all problems” in the country."

        author: "SHARON FERNANDES /",
        full_story: "The village of Raia undulates tenderly, rising to hills and sinking to level fields. It is a rich land with the River Zuari skirting its borders that are marked blood red with broad mud banks, which protect the Khazan or reclaimed lands near the river. The Khazans are fertile fields where everything that sustains a Goan can be grown – red rice, vegetables like tambdi baji (amaranth) and even small fish and succulent prawn, whose spawns are released in these fields. Every decade, the Khazans are flooded by the river water to cure the fields of pests.Ignacio Fernandes sits on the banks of a Khazan, waiting for his friends to join him this summer afternoon. He trudged up the tiny road that leads to the settlement of prawn breeders at Zuari village, a spot of land reclaimed from the river. On his way, he passed by the huge Rachol seminary that stands like a white sentinel, watching over the green fields. The bank Ignacio sits on will be swallowed up by the rising waters of the river during high tide, but right now, Ignacio dips his feet into the ankle-high water on the side of the bank and has used an old basket fashioned from palm fronds to catch some fat prawns. He skewers them on a twig and fashions a fish line from a stick and a small piece of rope, attaches a tiny prawn on one end and aims for a pool of frisky mackerel, waiting for them to bite."

        author: "HAIMA DESHPANDE /",
        full_story: "The sprawling white-and-yellow building of the Sanatan Sanstha—a hard-line Hindu organisation—stands out starkly against the backdrop of the tree-covered hill in Goa’s Bandora village, about 30 km from the capital Panaji. It appears quiet from outside. A few inmates of the ashram appear to be engaged in manual work in the courtyard. Situated between two of Goa’s most famous Hindu places of worship—the Shantadurga Temple and the Ramnathi Temple—the ashram appears to be an island of peace and serenity. The perfect place to meditate and cleanse the soul for those who come to this place.For others, the critics of the Sanatan Sanstha, the ashram’s serenity hides the organisation’s frequent brush with controversy, its alleged practice of hypnotising and brainwashing members and its run-ins with the law. But the Sanstha’s national spokesperson, Chetan Rajhans, dismisses the allegations as conspiracies by so-called rationalists and anti-Hindutva forces. “We promote the concept of Hindu Rashtra and we have devoted ourselves to the noble task of Hindu dharma. Therefore, we are always on the hit-list of jihadi terrorists,” he says. Headquartered in Ramnathi since 1999, the Sanstha generally prefers to keep away from the spotlight—there is very little information about its membership policy, and the locals are not allowed into the ashram. The Sanstha says it is open only to sadhaks (seekers). According to the website of the Sanstha, individuals are assessed on a scale of 1-100 to access their spiritual maturity. “Those who are members are not accessible. They do not speak. The few who have left the ashram too do not speak. So, there is no way of knowing their membership criteria. There are so many wealthy people who have donated their properties to the Sanstha and have become members,” a source says."
